This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

LOAD DATA

```{r}
if (!file.exists("pml-training.csv")) {
        download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", destfile = "pml-training.csv")
}
if (!file.exists("pml-testing.csv")) {
        download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", destfile = "pml-testing.csv")
}
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", sep = ",", na.strings = c("", "NA"))
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", sep = ",", na.strings = c("", "NA"))
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(plyr)
options(warn=-1)
```

CLEANUP THE DATA

```{r}
# Removing the starting 6 columns from the training and testing datasets :
#  'X',  'user_name', 'raw_timestamp_part_1', 'raw_timestamp_part_2', 'cvtd_timestamp', 'new_window'
testing <- subset(testing, select=-c(1:7))
training <- subset(training, select=-c(1:7))

# Putting a Threshold value for the check on the number of occurences of 'NA' or '""' empty values in the datasets
threshold_val <- 0.95 * dim(training)[1]

# Here we will be removing the columns which are fully 'NA' or full empty or have more than 95 % NA or empty values, and include rest of the columns
include_cols <- !apply(training, 2, function(y) sum(is.na(y)) > threshold_val || sum(y=="") > threshold_val)
training <- training[, include_cols]
```

Further Cleaning of Data

```{r}
# Removing the columns which have very low variance values, and including the favourable ones
nearZvar <- nearZeroVar(training, saveMetrics = TRUE)
training <- training[ , nearZvar$nzv==FALSE] 
dim(training)

# Making a correlation matrix to remove the columns which are highly correlated with each other
# Putting a threshold value check here as well
corr_matrix <- abs(cor(training[,-dim(training)[2]]))

# Making the default diagonal values from '1' to '0', so that these values aren't included later 
diag(corr_matrix) <- 0

# Here we will be removing the columns which are highly correlated
correlated_col <- findCorrelation(corr_matrix, verbose = FALSE , cutoff = .95)
training <- training[, -c(correlated_col)]
dim(training)

```

Modeling the data

```{r}
set.seed(32233)

# Dividing the training dataset in 2 parts with p=0.7
inTrain = createDataPartition(training$classe, p = 0.7, list=FALSE)
train1A <- training[inTrain,]
train2A <- training[-inTrain,]

# While creating the model, we have to specify 'importance=TRUE' for further ease in Variable-Importance plot.
# randForMod <- randomForest(classe~., data=train1A)
randomForMod <- randomForest(classe~., data=train1A, importance=TRUE)
randomForMod


# Testing the above model on train2A  dataset of the training dataset
train2A_pred <- predict(randomForMod, newdata=train2A)

# Showing the Confusion Matrix here :
confusionMatrix(train2A_pred, train2A$classe)
```

Checking Out-of-Sample error

```{r}        
confM <- confusionMatrix(train2A_pred, train2A$classe)
sum(diag(confM$table))/sum(confM$table)
```

Variable-Importance Plot

```{r}
# Performing the variable importance evaluation function using the above randomForest model:
# Using 'scale=FALSE' to avoid the automatic normalization done by the varImp() function
randomfImp <- varImp(randomForMod, scale=FALSE) 

# This gives the plot for the top 25 important variables
varImpPlot(randomForMod, top=25, main="Top 25 Variable Importance")

# Testing the model on the 'testing' dataset
testing_pred <- predict(randomForMod, newdata=testing)
testing_pred
```

Submit

```{r}
pml_write_files = function(x){
        n = length(x)
        for(i in 1:n){
                filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
                write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
        }
}

pml_write_files(as.character(testing_pred))
